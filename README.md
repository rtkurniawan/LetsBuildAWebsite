# Let's Build a Website!

**Step 1:** Let's check out HTML in the browser to ensure we have CSS linked and loaded.

 *hint* - Bootstrap?

 **Step 2:** Let's make this webstite our own! Change the headings in the NAV and H1 to include your name!

**Step 3:** Let's customize the images! 

*hint* - to keep formating look up 'ultra wide images for the full size images, and a   200x200 image for the small rounded one!

**Step 4:** Let's deploy! First we need to push all of our changes to github, then deploy using gitub pages! Github Pages is located in setting -> pages. It should look something like this: ![Pages Screenshot](/assets/images/pages.png)
